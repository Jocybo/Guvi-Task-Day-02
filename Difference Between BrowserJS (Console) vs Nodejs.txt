Difference between Browserjs Console vs Nodejs :


Browser JS Console :

1. window is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes.
2. Browsers may have an object named global, but it will be the exact one as window.
3. document, which is also another predefined global variable in browsers, has the html which is rendered.
4. Browsers don’t have require predefined. You may include it in your app for asynchronous file loading.

Nodejs :

1. Node doesn’t have a predefined window object it doesn’t have a window to draw anything.
2. Node has global, which is a predefined global object. It contains several functions that are not available in browsers, cause they are needed for server side works only.
3. Node doesn’t have document object also, it never have to render anything in a page.
4. Node require object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app.
